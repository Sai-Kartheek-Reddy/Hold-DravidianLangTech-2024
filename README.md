## Introduction
Hateful online content is a growing concern, especially for young people. While social media
platforms aim to connect us, they can also become breeding grounds for negativity and harmful language. This study tackles this issue by
proposing a novel framework called HOLD,
specifically designed to detect hate and offensive comments in Telugu-English(Tenglish) code-mixed
social media content. HOLD leverages a
combination of approaches, including three
powerful models: LSTM architecture, Zypher,
and openchat_3.5. The study highlights the
effectiveness of prompt engineering and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) in boosting performance of 7B Models.
